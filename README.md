## 1. Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive sales analysis and forecasting dashboard for a superstore. The primary goal is to provide actionable insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and regional distribution. The dashboard is divided into two main sections: a high-level Sales Dashboard for historical analysis and a Forecasting Dashboard to predict future sales trends.

This tool is designed to help business stakeholders, sales managers, and marketing teams make data-driven decisions to optimize sales strategies, manage inventory, and improve profitability.
